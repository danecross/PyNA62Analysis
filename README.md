# PyNA62Analysis

## Building the code
###### Note: This must be built on a CERN lxplus server as the libraries needed have a specific path on the lxplus computer. 
###### Note 2: the na62fw code must be in the same directory as the PyNA62Analysis clone. 
if you have never built the code before:

	source initialize_run_build.sh
	
set env variables for a new session:
	
	source initialize_run_source.sh
