# SummerProject

if you have never built the code before (or there is something wrong and a hard refresh is needed):

	source initialize_run_build.sh
	
set env variables and create the analyzer:
	
	source initialize_run_source.sh
	source create_analyzer.sh
	
Once you have everything how you want it (ie you have rewritten the templateAnalyzer code and are ready to compile):
	
	source build_analyzer.sh
	
take a close look at what is inside of build_analyzer.sh. If you are having problems with your results take a look at what you're compiling and where it goes.
