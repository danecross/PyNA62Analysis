                  particle that produced the hit
                - TSubDetHit::fDirectInteraction indicates if the hit was produced

                   responsibility region, but had the wrong polarity and the wrong field 
                   strength.

                  LKr optimization), and changed macros accordingly

                  it was not touched, suggesting the introduction of a memory error

                - Bug fixed in LAVOptTrack.cc: tracks passing both through the
                  LAVs and the RICH did not have hits in the RICH since the
                  fast simulation of the LAVs killed the optical photon associated

                - The default solution keeps minimum information for 
                  the main six Kaon decay modes: a track is saved if:

2010-09-30      Evelina Marinova

                The LKr MC simulation now includes a few new things:

                - full geometry of the flanges included
                - naive simulation of the materials between the back plate and the back cold window 
                 (to compensate for the electronics and cables materials). Simulated as cylindrical 
                 layers of a given thickness and material. 
                - NHOD included. Simulated as virtual trapezoids (as a part of the inner structure of the 
                  Parameterized Electrode cells - Parameterized VSpacers, therefore with a rectangular shapes, 
                  effectively covering the same surface as the cylindrical tubes of the real NHOD). 
                  Due to unknown error, scintillator could not be used for the scintillating fibers, 
                  PVC is used temporarily. The NHOD will be switched on (passive material only) if you 
                  compile with make MDEFINES="LKrNHOD=1".

                - Implemented quadrupole magnets QFS 077,079
                - New Cedar-compatible datacard BeamK09.app: fast beam
                  simulation stops at Cedar front plane
                - the old version of BeamK09.app moved to BeamK09_gtk1.app
                - Several hard-coded beam simulation constants modified
                  to become Cedar-compatible

                  will expand it in -D options for the compilation of
                  all source code (that's why it will be good practice
                  to prepend the SubDet name to your preprocessor
                  instructions)
                - Updated RICH geometry to latest knowledge
                - Revised Persistency implementation

                - Implemented SubDetector enabling/disabling capability
                  via macro (no need to comment/uncomment code), described
                  in macro/StandardRun.mac
                - Implemented automated conversion of G4 geometry to Root 
                  geometry file NA62.root (used in NA62EventDisplay; there
                  is still something to do in NA62Reconstruction package to
                  avoid problems): scripts/G4GeometryToRoot.csh
                - Fixed a small memory leak in RICHRootIO
                - There is still a small memory leak probably related to
                  persistency of hits in general

                - Added first version of ANTI0 geometry
                - Added ANTI0 in DetectorConstruction, RootIOManager
                  and GeometryParameters
                - Modified ResponsibilityRegion of GigaTracker:
                  position unchanged, ZLenght shrinked

                  G4 macro system
                - Added a sample macro (StandardRun.mac)
                - Redefined PhysicsList for custom particle Beam
                  (BeamPhysicsList) copying directly from standard
                  Kaon physics
                - Detector that are implemented still as empty

                - Abstraction of Subdetectors Event and Hit persistency

                  and TDetectorVHit
                - Obsolete TDCTrig and TDCHit classes redesigned as
                  base objects for TELL1-TDC like Digis, named now as
                  TDCEvent and TDCVHit
                - Added TRICHDigi as concrete implementation of TELL1-TDC
                  Digi
                - Now all percistency objects are designed to be fully
                  splitted in TTrees, so that data can be accessed both
                  by Object Oriented and old fashioned NTUPLE approach.
                  Also performance should be improved
                - Removed a bug in Subdetector MaterialParameters that
                  used to cause crash if RICH was disabled
                - Investigated the CXXFLAGS issue in GNUmakefile; removed
                  only -pedantic option from G4 standard CXXFLAGS. It
                  should not be harmful
                - Added PDGcharge to MCTruth information
                - Fixed a bug in BumpBonding material definition in GigaTracker 
                - Changed a variable name (Info->Infos) in Beam/include/parm.h 
                  Beam/src/carte.cc for a compilation issue

                - Rationalization of makefiles
                - Modified the csh script to set environment
                  variables properly for Geant4(geant4.9.1.p01) 
                  and ROOT (5.18.00a) for slc4_amd64_gcc34
                - Added T(SubDet)Event classes as examples in
                  still empty subdetectors, and modified the
                  corresponding (SubDet)RootIO
                - Added a rootlogon.C macro to load persistency
                  libraries to easily check output ROOT trees

                - Completed the structure of the Spectrometer
                  (4 Chambers, 4 views each, and 1 Magnet),
                  accordingly with BEATCH file (04/04/2008) 
                  and specs from latest Collaboration Meeting.
                - Persistency of hits is implemented.

2008-04-23      Simone Bifani:
                - Implemented GigaTracker geometry:
                  - 300 x 300 x 300 um^3 sensitive silicon pixel
                  - 3 60 x 27 mm^2 stations (GTK2 displacement: x = +60 mm)

                  according to BEATCH file (04/04/2008)
                - The following GigaTracker hit information are recorded 
                  on the output ROOT file:
                  - pixel ID
                  - station ID
                  - position
                  - deposited energy

2008-04-07      Antonino Sergi: 
                - First public version with templates for
                  subdetectors and a fairly advanced
                  version of the RICH
                - PrimaryGeneratorAction class provides a basic
                  single particle beam for testing purpose
                - Subdetectors template have been positioned
                  roughly in their own positions, starting
                  from the beatch file 
                  http://doble.web.cern.ch/doble/k12hika+.txt
                  For multi-segment subdetectors, just one has
                  been positioned
                - RootIOManager and related classes provide the
                  persistency of objects based on Root (derived
                  from a project by Emanuele Leonardi).
                - Parameters classes are meant to keep all the
                  detectors design information in easily reachable
                  places, waiting for a database solution
                - MCTruth classes provide the possibility to save
                  the whole event structure for hits/digis association
                - NA62V classes define a common structure for
                  subdetectors
