                - Patched channel handling in IRC/SAC, but it's all very cofused and
                  and it should be cleaned up; the patch works only if a T0 file is provided
                  otherwise slewing corrections go to infinity

                  The buffer size has been decreased,
                  with consequent virtual memory saving.

2015-01-22      Giuseppe Ruggiero (giuseppe.ruggiero@cern.ch)
                rev. 405
                - Spectrometer reconstruction working both on data and mc.
                  This reconstruction can be used only to reconstruct straw-merged data from run 1348 
                  (a subsample can be found in /merger3/straw/straw_cdr/*01348*.dat).
                - This reconstruction is a first simplified version useful to reconstruct 
                  tracks with 3 chamber configuration (1-2-4). It makes use of 3 chambers 
                  also in mc.
                - SRBRawDecoder added. The data decoding is based on the 2014 straw data format.
                - file Spectrometer/chanconversion.txt used to map hardware and software channels.
                - file Spectrometer/strawt0.txt used for t0s. This is a preliminary version
                  of t0s' tested only on run1348.
                - Spectrometer.conf file modified. The first line controls the type of file:
                  it could be "data" (default) or "mc".
                - The CHOD must be present in NA62Reconstruction.conf when reconstructing data
                  (it must be placed before Spectrometer in the detector sequence). 
                - An R-T dependence extracted from Garfield simulation is used when reconstructing data.
                - Two digitization versions can be used when running on mc: 
                  1) full simulation of the analog signal (see rev.324)
                  2) parametric digitization based on empirical R-T curves from Garfield simulation.
                  Default is 2. The following procedure is needed to use 1:
                  Comment line 10 in SpectrometerDigiManager.cc
                  Comment line 9 in SpectrometerDigitizer.hh
                  re-compile.
                - A naive least squared fit assuming a uniform magnetic field in MNP33 is implemented. 
                  The fit is not optimized and will be re-written in future releases.
                - The relevant track variables for the analysis are:
                  fCandidates.fNHits (Number of straw hits per reconstructed track),
                              fTime  (Trailing time of a track)
                              fFastMomentum (momentum magitude times track charge before fit)
                              fFastThetaX,fFastThetaY (slopes of the track before fit at the origin (Z=0))
                              fPositionLoose (position of the track at the origin after the fit)
                              fMomentumLoose (4-momentum of the track after the fit)
                              fChi2Loose (chi2 of the fit)
                              fChargeLoose (charge of the track)
                  This output format is temporary and will be modified in future releases. 
                - Minor changes in RecoBase/src/TDCBRawDecoder.cc to allow the decoding of the straw data.

                rev. 324 
                - Spectrometer digitization as developed on 2010 test beam data:
                  - the parametric version is no longer available (no time to reimplement it)
                  - the input to the reconstruction matches expectations
                  - time offsets are handled properly
                  - there is a workaround for channel numbering compatiblity with old MC and reco
                  - several configuration parameters in Spectrometer.conf
                  - ready for overlay (few tests to perform, but working)
                - Some modification to the input stage of Spectrometer reconstruction
                  to cope with digitization:
                  - removed handling of fake digis
                  - introduced handling of T0
                - Added a tentative channel map for readout electronics
                - Added T0s in Spectrometer.conf
                - Introduced standard variables in NA62VDigitizer and NA62VReconstruction to properly handle
                  time offsets from MC and data (for detector stations and channels):
                  fStationsMCToF, fStationsT0, fT0
                  They should not be redefined, but used
                - Introduced a new debugging tool:
                  debug printouts can be activated at compilation
                  time in a standard way. For example:
                  make MDEFINES="DEBUG=AllRecoSpectrometerDigi"
                  See SpectrometerDigitizer.cc to see how to use it
                - Added dependencies to the main makefile
                - Fixed a bug in ViewHitCollector introduced in rev 297

                rev. 122
                - First LAV reconstruction for signal digitization has been committed, 
                  The following classes have been added (A) or modified (M):
                   - LAVDigitizer (M)         Main class now handling the signal generation process and digi storage through TLAVDigi.
                     - LAVReco (A)          | contains info concerning the whole detector, such as stations and blocks with hits.
                     - LAVRecoStation (A)   | contains info concerning the stations, such as layers with hits.
                     - LAVRecoLayer (A)     | contains info concerning the layers.
                     - LAVRecoBanana (A)    | contains info concerning the Bananas.
                     - LAVRecoBlock (A)     | contains info concerning the Blocks, such as charge (temporary), trailing and leading times.
                     - LAVpmt (A)           | handles the signal generation processing using the following classes:
                       - LAVPhotocathode (A)  Generates photoelectron time distribution from the input photon time distribution.
                       - LAVDynode (A)        Handles the p.e. distribution using both FFT and gaussian smearing, to account for time fluctuations (transit time spread). 
                       - LAVDivider (A)       Generates the PMT Signal and evaluates trailing and leading times for a given threshold.
                   - LAVGeometry (M)          Contains info concerning signal simulation parameters (tts, gain, QE, threshold, etc.), 
                                              In future, we will include a block-by-block parametrization.            
                   - LAVConvolution (A)       Convolves a given time distribution with a gaussian provided by LAVWrapAround using TVirtualFFT.         
                     - LAVWrapAround (A)      Contains utilities for the manipulation of the gaussian used for signal smearing.
                - LAVName (A)                 Handles LAV Block names, gives back also the ID of neighbouring blocks.   
        

2011-03-10      Mario Vormstein

2011-01-10      Vito Palladino
                - First basic CHANTI reconstruction has been implemented. Information about energy release for each bar are available.
                - no digitization, no clusterig and no signal shaping are applied.

2010-09-23      Antonino Sergi
                - Fixed a bug in the reconstruction sequence handling causing crashes when using more
                  than 1 reconstruction algorithm (based on Alban Jago experience)
                - Fixed presence of multiple instacnces of the same TTree in the output file (A. Jago)
                - Enabled by default the reconstruction of RICH GigaTracker Spectrometer and LKr (the only ones
                  actually implemented)

2010-09-17      Giuseppe Ruggiero
                - Some changes in the reconstruction algorithm in order to optimize 
                  the reconstruction efficiency and resolution also in case of multi-track events:
                  1) some values in the Spectrometer.conf file changed;
                  2) no geometrical checks on the chamber-hits composed by 3-4 views;
                  3) 4-hits track pattern recognition algorithm slightly modified.
                - NA62MC hits stored together with the reconstructed tracks to access
                  in a simple way at the hits used for track reconstruction. 
                  see Spectrometer/TipsOnTrackReconstruction.cc_example for some tips about
                  the manipulation of the reconstructed tracks. 
                - The value SMOOT_EFF in Spectrometer/include/StrawResponse.hh has been
                  set to 1 to avoid some clashes with the reconstruction algorithm.

2010-04-28      Dmitry Madigozhin
                - A first-order digitization for the Spectrometer, 
                  described in note NA62-10-01. Treats double hits.
                  Sets the simulated drift time and the measured 
                  distance to wire, obtained with the true RT function.
                  Zero-order digitization (old R smearing) may be 
                  choosen by preprocessor.

2010-03-10      Antonino Sergi
                - Applied modifications to RICH module to fit the latest MC
                  revision
                - Updated RICH module to latest reconstruction developed
                  on test beam data 
                - Updated to work both on SLC4 and SLC5

2010-02-22     Evelina Marinova:
               - Very basic reconstruction of the LKr implemented. Returns energy of the 
                 cluster and position of the cluster.
                 LKrMonitor root branch of the Output root tree contains couple of 
                 histograms related to the LKr reconstruction.
               - No corrections applied. No callibration applied. No minimum treshhold 
                 for the signal applied. 
                 No noise added to the cells for the simulation.         


2010-01-21      Giuseppe Ruggiero:
                - Many improvements in the SpectrometerReconstruction:
                  - Fully documentation via doxygen added.
                  - The class TRecoSpectrometerCandidate and TRecoSpectrometerHit
                    are now used to store the reconstructed variables. The variables
                    can be stored also in the output tree. 
                  - Some bugs fixed in the LR ambiguity solution algorithm 
                    (ReconstructionPosition method of the SpectrometerReconstruction class).
                  - Other bugs fixed in the FastFit method of the TrackCollector class.
                    Now the fast measurements of the track parameters are correct.
                  - Many improvements in the fitting algorithms (Track and TrackCollector)
                    and in the gmatrix class. Now the reconstruction is 30% faster.
                  - Almost all the parameters of the reconstruction are passed via
                    a configuration file (config/Spectrometer.conf).
                - Modified Spectrometer/SpectrometerLinkDef.hh to read the 
                  TRecoSpectrometerCandidate class and parTrack structure stored in 
                  the output tree of NA62MC.
                - NA62EventDisplay.cc modified because of sligthly different 
                  methods to call the reconstructed spectrometer variables.

2009-11-06      Massimiliano Fiorini:
                - Implemented new version of the GigaTracker Reconstruction.
                  Algorithm working (for the moment) only in case of events 
                  with 1 track.
                  
2009-10-17      Antonino Sergi:
                - Major changes in the program flow, which now is
                  configurable via config/NA62Reconstruction.conf
                  file
                - Base classes moved to RecoBase to avoid cross
                  referenced libraries
                - Added Digitizer modules, to be filled with
                  specific algorithms
                - Moved RICH digitization from RICHRootIO
                  to RICHDigitizer
                - Added RawDecoding mechanism wich an actual
                  working example for the RICH
                - NA62VReconstruction class slightly changed
                  to allow a more flexible usage and data processing
                - Full and wide usage of the new Persistency features
                  for implementing selectable output in TTrees; each
                  stage of the reconstruction has a link to the previous
                  one (at runtime ... the link is not persistent but it
                  could easily be so)
                - Added multiversioning capability introducing
                  the possibility to build libraries for each submodule
                  and choose the actual one at runtime (an actual working
                  example is RICHRawDecoder), by means of a new base class
                  (NA62VNamedModule)
                - Each Reconstruction module is now provided with
                  the MCTruth event, if available, for full MCTruth
                  association
                - NA62EventDisplay now finds dynamically the magnets
                  volumes, so that changing the geometry file it would
                  adapdt itself
                - NA62Reconstruction class is now fully documented using 
                  doxygen syntax and represents an example of what can 
                  be done and how to do it
                - Added several configuraition files for RICH
                - Added RFIO support
                - Added multiple input file support via input lists
                - Added few command line parameters for NA62Analysis
                  and NA62EventDisplay (-h for help)
                - Added G4 system of units, physical constants and
                  particles table (most common PDG particles ready
                  for usage in each Reconstruction module), to avoid
                  mismatched numbers, possible confusion and hardcoded
                  constants

2009-09-29      Giuseppe Ruggiero:
                - New version of the Straw Chamber Reconstruction.
                  Some bugs fixed. 
                  Algorithm working also in case of events with >1 
                  track. 
                  Structure of the public variables of the
                  Track class changed.
                - Possibility of choosing the seed of the
                  random generator for Spectrometer Reconstruction
                  (see NA62Analysis.cc).

2009-08-10      Antonino Sergi:
                - Updated geometry file to include MUV
                - Added CHOD and MUV empty reconstruction

2009-08-06      Giuseppe Ruggiero:
                - First version of the Straw Chamber Reconstruction
                - An example of how to call the reconstructed spectrometer
                  variables added in NA62Analysis.cc

2009-04-24      Simone Bifani:
                - Implemented a basic GigaTracker reconstruction class

2009-03-04      Simone Bifani:
                - Updated NA62.root according to the latest geometry
                  configuration
                - Updated TNA62MagField.cc with the corresponding
                  magnet volume numbers

2009-02-03      Antonino Sergi:
                - Updated Persistency interface to the restructured
                  one available in NA62MC since 2009-01-23
                - Completed integration of RICH reconstruction
                  up to date with latest data analysis from laboratory 
                  tests
                - Introduced RICH trigger algorithm 
                - Started to introduce configuration files (plain txt)
                  for individual reconstruction modules (now for RICH)
                - First public version of NA62EventDisplay, for now as
                  a visualization tool
                - Added ANTI0 reconstruction classes (without algorithms)
                - The package now is compiled statically with both
                  Persistency and reconstruction libraries

2008-05-06      Antonino Sergi:
                - First public version with reconstruction templates
                  for subdetectors and a fairly advanced
                  version for the Spectrometer and RICH (not fully
                  integrated)
                - NA62Analysis provides a basic loop with
                  a rough example about how to get information from
                  reconstruction classes
                - This first version is intended to give the possibility
                  to developers to begin to insert the reconstruction
                  class related to their own subdetectors, inheriting
                  from NA62VReconstruction
                - Geometry is a temporary solution, similar to what has been
                  done for NA62MC, waiting for a database solution
