This directory hosts the software to interact with the NA62 offline database.
To compile the NA62DB libraries:
1. cd NA62DB (this directory)
2. source scripts/env.sh
3. cmake . (this is needed only the first time)
4. make
5. make install

Libraries and executables will be installed in NA62DB/lib and NA62DB/bin, respectively.
At the moment, the only detector for which a code is present is LAV.
For LAV, we use the following executables:

- LAV_initialize (prepare low-level tables in the db)
- LAV_setup (define data types, subsystem types and attributes; fill the db)
- LAV_test (read-access test with the db)

PASSWORD FOR DB ACCESS IN authentication.xml HAS TO BE REQUESTED TO THE SW COORDINATOR (A. SERGI).
