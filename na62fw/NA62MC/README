Visualization

As an example for visualization you can use macros/ExampleVis.mac, that uses
HepRep, but be careful; the number of volumes determines the size of the 
HepRep (xml) file. For example: ~2000 Photomultipliers in the RICH correspond
to a ~380MB file.
NA62EventDisplay can be used to visualize the geometry; it reads it from NA62.root
file, part of NA62Reconstruction package, which hold the standard geometry. It can
be generated after modification to detectors construction using scripts/GeometryToRoot.csh

Program running

NA62MC executable looks for vis.mac file by default if no command line argument
is provided, otherwise it takes the first argument as filename of the macro to
execute

Beam added
Example of execution in scripts/run.csh
