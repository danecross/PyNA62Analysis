Configuration of the GigaTracker Stations
=========================================
The current solution is a temporary solution waiting for the final condition DB.
A proxy class "GigaTrackerParameters" connects to a SQLite DB holding the parameters.
In the future, the class can be adapted to connect to the Oracle DB, minimising the required code modifications.

Usage
-----
By default nothing changes for the end-user. 
The 'config/GigaTracker.conf' file allows to set the path to the SQLite DB. 
If the file is not present or is some configuration keys are missing the nominal parameters are used.

At the moment a limited set of parameters a available: 
    - Adjust the position of the GTK station 2 on the Y and Z axis,
    - Adjust the chip thickness,
    - Enable/disable a GigaTracker station.

No bound checks are implemented, the user should be careful with values he chooses.

The script 'config/GTK_RunCond.sh' allows the users to write into the DB.
The are two options:
- If run number is passed to the script, the values corresponding the particular run are used.
- If the script is called without run number, nominal values are loaded.

The run - setting mapping defined in GTK_RunCond.sh are extracted from the elog and the GTK logbook.
Use the mapping with care, don't hesitate to double check for your particular run.

Data Base Structure
-------------------
This section is for experts.

The parameters are stored in 'parameters' table. 
The are three column 
- key (TEXT),
- value (NUMERIC)
- comment (TEXT)

Look at the comment column for hints on the units, etc.
