- DigiMat

This is a tool to generate the matrix needed by the non optical simulation of the LAV block.

Usage:
DigiMat CHID file1.root file2.root ... fileN.root

CHID is the channel id of the block used to generate the matrix.
Listed files are the files to preocess to produce the matrix.
In the execution folder there must be a LAVSampleMatrix saved file, called "MatrixHeader.txt". DigiMat will load the matrix definition (dimensions and bin separation) from it.

To generate correct root files, you have to shoot opticalphotons inside a block of the LAV. An example macro is macro/LAVMatrixSampling.mac. Note that DigiMat tool and /MatrixGun/channelId macro command must have the same CHID parameter.

The output will be:
Gen_DZe_PZe_ENe_PRe_DFe_PFe.txt containing a matrix of generated photons
Hit_DZe_PZe_ENe_PRe_DFe_PFe.txt containing a matrix of number of photons that reached the photocathode
Tim_DZe_PZe_ENe_PRe_DFe_PFe.txt containing a matrix of the sum of the arrival time of the photons on the photocathode
Means.txt logging some global information (total generated photons, etc)
LAVEff.txt containing a bin-by-bin ratio between Hit and Gen matrices
LAVDelay.txt containing a bin-by-bin ratio between Tim and Gen matrices

- AddMat

This is an utility to add matrices bin by bin

Usage:
AddMat MatA.txt MatB.txt

It will add the matrices in MatA.txt and MatB.txt and it will place the result in MatB.txt.

- DivMat

This is an utility to divide matrices bin by bin

Usage:
DivMat MatA.txt MatB.txt

It will compute MatB.txt/MatA.txt (bin-by-bin) and it will place the result in MatB.txt.
